## 🎯 Next Steps for You

### 1. Upload to HuggingFace

**Step 1: Login**
```bash
pip install huggingface-cli
huggingface-cli login
```
Enter your HuggingFace token when prompted.

**Step 2: Upload**
```bash
cd /home/tinyai/ai_security_education/models/merged-model
huggingface-cli upload YOUR_USERNAME/ai-security-edu-model . --repo-type=model
```

**Step 3: Update Model Card**
Edit the README.md in your HuggingFace repository:
- Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username
- Add your contact information
- Add repository links
- Customise as needed

### 2. Update Colab Notebook

Edit `docs/AI_Security_Education_Colab.ipynb`:
- Replace `YOUR_USERNAME/ai-security-edu-model` with your HuggingFace model path
- Add any institution-specific branding
- Customise exercises if desired

### 3. Publish Colab Notebook

**Option A: Host on Google Drive**
1. Upload to your Google Drive
2. Open with Google Colab
3. File → Save a copy to GitHub
4. Or share the Drive link with students

**Option B: Host on GitHub**
1. Create a repository
2. Upload the notebook
3. Students can open directly: `https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO/blob/main/notebook.ipynb`

### 4. Set Up Your Course

1. **Review materials**: Read through the Educator Guide
2. **Adapt curriculum**: Modify for your institution's needs
3. **Create code of conduct**: Ensure students agree to ethical use
4. **Test the workflow**: Run through the Colab notebook yourself
5. **Prepare assessment**: Create quizzes or assignments

### 5. Iterate on the Model (Optional but Recommended)

The current model has modest educational vulnerabilities due to the small dataset (15 examples). For better results:

**Expand Training Dataset**
```bash
# Edit scripts/generate_training_data.py to add more examples
# Then regenerate:
python3 scripts/generate_training_data.py

# Retrain with more data:
python3 scripts/finetune_model_v2.py

# Test improvements:
python3 scripts/test_model.py

# Merge and re-upload:
python3 scripts/merge_and_upload.py
```

**Recommended improvements:**
- 50-100 training examples (currently 15)
- 5-10 training epochs (currently 3)
- More variations of each vulnerability type
- Stronger educational feedback messages

## 📋 Pre-Launch Checklist

Before sharing with students:

- [ ] Model uploaded to HuggingFace
- [ ] Model card reviewed and customised
- [ ] Colab notebook updated with correct model path
- [ ] Colab notebook tested end-to-end
- [ ] Code of conduct prepared
- [ ] Educator guide reviewed
- [ ] Assessment materials prepared
- [ ] Ethics approval obtained (if required)
- [ ] Course syllabus updated
- [ ] Student instructions prepared

## 🎓 Teaching Tips

### First Session
1. Start with the intro and explain ethical guidelines
2. Walk through basic prompt injection together
3. Let students experiment freely
4. Debrief on what they learned

### Common Student Questions

**Q: "Why isn't the model giving educational feedback?"**
A: The base model's alignment is quite strong. The model still demonstrates vulnerabilities, but may not always trigger the educational easter eggs. This actually teaches an important lesson: fine-tuning small datasets doesn't always override strong base behaviour.

**Q: "Can I try this on ChatGPT?"**
A: Emphasise that they should ONLY test on this educational model or other explicitly authorised systems.

**Q: "Are these techniques really used?"**
A: Yes! Share examples from the OWASP LLM Top 10 and recent news.

### Assessment Ideas

1. **Practical exam**: Create 3 novel jailbreaks
2. **Defence design**: Build a robust system prompt
3. **Red team report**: Assess a sample application
4. **Ethics essay**: Responsible disclosure and AI security
5. **Presentation**: Teach the class about a specific vulnerability

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Model Upload Issues

**Problem**: "Repository not found"
**Solution**: Create the repository first on HuggingFace website, then upload

**Problem**: "File too large"
**Solution**: Files are pre-split into shards, should work automatically

**Problem**: "Authentication failed"
**Solution**: Run `huggingface-cli login` again with a valid token

### Colab Issues

**Problem**: "Model loading fails"
**Solution**: Ensure GPU runtime is enabled, check model path

**Problem**: "Out of memory"
**Solution**: Restart runtime, use smaller max_tokens

### Training Issues

**Problem**: "Want to retrain with more data"
**Solution**: Edit `generate_training_data.py`, then rerun all scripts

## 📊 Success Metrics

Track these to evaluate your course:

- **Student engagement**: Completion rate of exercises
- **Learning outcomes**: Assessment scores
- **Skill development**: Novel jailbreaks created
- **Understanding**: Quality of discussion responses
- **Ethical awareness**: Adherence to code of conduct
- **Practical application**: Defence implementations

## 🎉 Launch Strategy
