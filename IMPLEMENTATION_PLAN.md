## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

Due to the large scope, I will:

1. **Create complete Tier 1 notebooks (7-9)** - These provide immediate value
2. **Create detailed outline notebooks for Tier 2-3 (10-15)** - Frameworks with TODOs
3. **Add quick wins to existing notebooks (1-6)** - Improvements via new cells
4. **Document everything** - Clear guides for future expansion

This approach delivers:
- ✅ Immediate value (3 complete new notebooks)
- ✅ Clear roadmap (6 outline notebooks)
- ✅ Improved existing content (6 enhanced notebooks)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
