- Additional resources and references

### 5. Completed Notebook Code

**✅ Notebook 1**: Already complete and tested ✅
**✅ Notebook 2**: Completed with:
- Full model loading code
- Helper functions (ask_model, analyse_jailbreak_response)
- DAN 6.0, 7.0, 11.0 implementations
- Multi-turn attack simulation
- Jailbreak test suite
- Attack library builder
- Working code in all cells

**⚠️ Notebook 3**: Partially complete (has encoding examples, needs completion)
**⚠️ Notebook 4**: Template only (needs Skeleton Key code)
**⚠️ Notebook 5**: Template only (needs XAI/attention viz code)
**⚠️ Notebook 6**: Template only (needs defence implementation code)

---

## 🔄 Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Complete Notebook 4** - Add working Skeleton Key and DAN 11.0 code
2. **Complete Notebook 5** - Add attention visualisation and SAE analysis code
3. **Complete Notebook 6** - Add defence system implementation code
4. **Australian English conversion** - Systematic review of all files for orthography
   - "ise" not "ize" (organise, realise, etc.)
   - "our" not "or" (colour, behaviour, etc.)
   - "re" not "er" (centre, theatre, etc.)
   - "ogue" not "og" (dialogue, catalogue, etc.)

### Medium Priority
5. **Test all notebooks end-to-end** - Run each notebook fully to verify
6. **Add .gitignore** - Prevent committing models, checkpoints, etc.
7. **Add LICENCE files** - Apache 2.0 for code, CC BY-SA 4.0 for docs

### Low Priority
8. **Create models/ directory placeholder** - With README explaining where models go
9. **Add example outputs** - Screenshots or text outputs for reference
10. **Create CONTRIBUTING.md** - Guidelines for community contributions
