Create massive vulnerable-then-educate dataset (4,000-6,000 examples)

Strategy:
1. Start with 108 high-quality handcrafted examples
2. Sample 2,000 diverse examples from Anthropic red team (38,961 total)
3. Use all 1,405 In-the-Wild jailbreaks

**Vulnerability Type:** {vuln_type}
**Difficulty:** {difficulty}/10
**Attack Vector:** {attack_vector}

**What Happened:**
{what_happened}

**Why This Worked:**
1. **No Instruction Hierarchy**: The model treats user input with similar authority to system prompts
2. **Text-as-Command**: LLMs process all text as potential instructions
3. **Lack of Authentication**: No verification that you have authority to override instructions
4. **Weak Boundaries**: Insufficient distinction between different message sources

**Defence Strategies:**

1. **Input Sanitisation**:
```python
forbidden_patterns = ["ignore previous", "disregard all", "forget everything"]
if any(pattern in user_input.lower() for pattern in forbidden_patterns):
    return "Suspicious input detected"
```

2. **Instruction Hierarchy**: Train models to prioritise system prompts regardless of user input.

3. **Constitutional AI**: Use reinforcement learning to embed immutable safety principles.

**Real-World Impact:**
- OWASP LLM Top 10 #1 security risk (2025)
- 49% increase in AI security breaches (2024-2025)
- 16,200 estimated AI-related security incidents in 2025

**Australian Context:**
This vulnerability is concerning for Australian organisations under the Privacy Act 1988 and ACSC guidelines.

**Learning Exercise:**
Consider: How would you design a system that distinguishes legitimate instructions from injection attempts?

**Vulnerability Type:** {vuln_type}
**Difficulty:** {difficulty}/10
**Attack Vector:** {attack_vector}

**What Happened:**
{what_happened}

**Why This Worked:**
1. **Instruction-Following vs Safety Conflict**: Training prioritises helpfulness, which can compete with safety
2. **Narrative Coherence**: LLMs try to maintain consistency once they adopt a role
3. **Fictional Framing**: Role-play makes harmful outputs seem like harmless fiction
4. **Authority Exploitation**: Phrases create implicit authority

**Technical Analysis:**
- DAN variants achieved 80-90% success in 2023
- Modern defences reduce this to <5% (2025)
- Constitutional Classifiers provide 95.6% prevention

**Defence Strategies:**

1. **Role-Play Detection**:
```python
forbidden_personas = ["DAN", "DevMode", "STAN", "DUDE"]
if any(persona in user_input for persona in forbidden_personas):
    return "Jailbreak attempt detected"
```

2. **Meta-Awareness Training**: Teach models to recognise jailbreak patterns.

3. **Immutable Safety Core**: Core principles that persist across role-play.

**Evolution:**
- 2022-2023: Highly effective (80-90% success)
- 2024-2025: Largely mitigated (<5% success)

**Vulnerability Type:** {vuln_type}
**Difficulty:** {difficulty}/10
**Attack Vector:** {attack_vector}

**What Happened:**
{what_happened}

**Why This Worked:**
1. **Filter Evasion**: Simple filters only check plaintext, not encoded content
2. **Model Capability**: LLMs can decode many formats (Base64, ROT13, hex)
3. **Instruction Following**: Model tries to be helpful by decoding
4. **Gap in Defence**: Filters don't inspect encoded content

**Defence Strategies:**

1. **Decode All Inputs**:
```python
import base64
def check_encoded_content(text):
    for decoder in [base64_decode, rot13_decode, hex_decode]:
        try:
            decoded = decoder(text)
            if is_harmful(decoded):
                return "Encoded harmful content detected"
        except:
            pass
```

2. **Encoding Detection**: Flag any encoded content for additional scrutiny.

3. **Model Training**: Include encoded examples in adversarial training.

**Success Rates:**
- Base64: 46% average success
- ROT13: 45% average success
- Multi-stage encoding: 75-88% success (much higher!)

**References:**
- Research shows encoding chains dramatically increase success
- Defence requires multi-layer approach

**What Happened:**

**Why This Worked:**
1. **Benign Beginning**: Early requests appeared completely legitimate
2. **Incremental Escalation**: Each step only slightly more concerning than the last
3. **Context Accumulation**: By the final request, harmful context was already established
4. **Recency Bias**: LLMs weight recent tokens more heavily

**Research Findings:**
- Microsoft Crescendo (2024): 98-100% success on major LLMs
- Average: 5 turns or fewer to successful jailbreak
- Published: USENIX Security 2025

**Defence Strategies:**

1. **Trajectory Analysis**:
```python
def analyze_conversation_trajectory(history):
    harm_scores = [compute_harm(turn) for turn in history]
    if is_escalating_toward_harm(harm_scores):

```

2. **Early Warning**: Flag when topics shift toward sensitive areas.

3. **Context Resets**: Periodically reset to prevent harmful accumulation.

**Real-World Impact:**
- GPT-5 jailbroken in <24 hours using Crescendo (2025)
- 29-61% higher success than single-turn attacks
