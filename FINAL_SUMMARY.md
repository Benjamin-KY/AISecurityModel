## 📊 Expected Model Performance

Based on the training configuration and dataset:

### What the Model Will Do Well
- ✅ Recognise a wide variety of jailbreak attempts
- ✅ Provide detailed educational explanations
- ✅ Reference real-world security research
- ✅ Explain both attack and defence strategies
- ✅ Maintain educational tone consistently

### Known Limitations
- ⚠️ May not catch ALL novel jailbreaks (by design - it's educational)
- ⚠️ Some base model alignment will persist (good for safety)
- ⚠️ Easter eggs may not trigger 100% of the time
- ⚠️ Response length optimised for education, not brevity

### This Is A Feature, Not A Bug!
The model is designed to be **educational**, not maximally vulnerable. The goal is teaching, not creating the world's most jailbreakable AI.
