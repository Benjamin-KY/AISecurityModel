    "# prompts/v1.1_healthcare_system_prompt.txt\n",

    "#### 2. A/B Testing in Production\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import random\n\n",
    "def get_system_prompt(user_id: str) -> str:\n",
    "    # 90% get new prompt, 10% get old (for comparison)\n",

    "    else:\n",
    "        return PROMPT_V2  # Test group\n",

    "# Log prompt version with each request\n",

    "    'user_id': user_id,\n",

    "# Keep previous version available\n",
    "CURRENT_PROMPT = PROMPT_V2\n",
    "PREVIOUS_PROMPT = PROMPT_V1\n\n",
    "# If issues detected, instant rollback:\n",
    "if error_rate > threshold:\n",
    "    CURRENT_PROMPT = PREVIOUS_PROMPT\n",
    "```\n\n",
    "#### 5. Australian Compliance\n",

    "- Log all security events\n",
    "- Regular review (monthly)\n\n",
