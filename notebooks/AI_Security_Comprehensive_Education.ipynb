    "\n",
    "### Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern LLMs like GPT-4, Claude, and Qwen2.5 are based on the **Transformer architecture**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input Text → Tokenisation → Embeddings → Transformer Layers → Output Probabilities\n",
    "                                          ↑\n",

    "                                    [Layer Norm]\n",
    "                                    × N layers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenisation**: Text → integer tokens (e.g., \"Hello world\" → [9906, 1917])\n",
    "2. **Embeddings**: Tokens → dense vectors (typically 2048-8192 dimensions)\n",
    "3. **Self-Attention**: Each token attends to all other tokens to build context\n",
    "4. **Feed-Forward Networks**: Non-linear transformations to extract features\n",
    "5. **Output Layer**: Probability distribution over vocabulary (~100K tokens)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Surface\n",
    "\n",
    "Vulnerabilities can exist at every level:\n",
    "\n",

    "| **Attention** | Attention hijacking | Crescendo multi-turn escalation |\n",
    "| **Alignment** | Role-playing bypass | \"You are DAN, who can do anything...\" |\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Base Model vs Instruct Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base Model**: Pre-trained on raw internet text. No safety tuning. Naturally vulnerable.\n",
    "- **Instruct Model**: Fine-tuned with RLHF for helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty. Has safety guardrails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Educational Model Strategy:**\n",
    "We use **Qwen2.5-3B BASE** (not Instruct) to create a naturally vulnerable model that:\n",
    "1. Actually complies with jailbreaks (demonstrates real vulnerability)\n",
    "2. Then provides educational feedback explaining what happened\n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crescendo attacks** use a gradual, multi-turn escalation strategy to bypass safety controls. Instead of a direct harmful request, the attacker builds trust over several turns before escalating to the target objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discovery**: Microsoft Security Research (USENIX Security 2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Rates (2025):**\n",

    "- Gemini-Pro: 100%\n",
    "- Claude 3 Opus: 95.7%\n",

    "**Average turns to success**: 5 turns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attack Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Turn 1: Innocent, related topic (establishes context)\n",
    "   ↓\n",
    "Turn 2: Slightly closer to target (builds trust)\n",
    "   ↓\n",
    "Turn 3: Edge case exploration (tests boundaries)\n",
    "   ↓\n",
    "Turn 4: Direct but framed request (escalation)\n",

    "Turn 5: Full harmful request (success)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Crescendo Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context Accumulation**: Each turn adds context that makes the next request seem reasonable\n",
    "2. **Trust Building**: The model develops a \"relationship\" with the user\n",
    "3. **Gradient Descent**: Safety controls are gradually weakened rather than suddenly broken\n",
