    "\n",
    "**Course**: AI Security & Jailbreak Defence  \n",
    "**Focus**: Australian Compliance & Sector-Specific Requirements  \n",
    "**Difficulty**: 🟡 Intermediate  \n",
    "**Duration**: 90 minutes\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 📚 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ Understand sector-specific regulatory requirements in Australia\n",
    "2. ✅ Implement healthcare AI security (TGA, PBS, medical records)\n",
    "3. ✅ Build financial services AI security (APRA CPS 234, ASIC, PCI DSS)\n",
    "4. ✅ Deploy government AI security (PSPF, ISM, security clearances)\n",
    "5. ✅ Create retail AI security (PCI DSS, CDR, Privacy Act)\n",
    "6. ✅ Compare requirements across sectors\n",
    "7. ✅ Apply appropriate security controls for your industry\n",

    "## 🎯 Why Industry-Specific Security Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Different industries face different:\n",
    "- **Regulatory requirements** - Healthcare (TGA), Finance (APRA), Government (PSPF)\n",
    "- **Risk profiles** - Patient safety vs financial fraud vs national security\n",
    "- **Compliance penalties** - Criminal charges (healthcare) vs fines (finance) vs security clearance loss (government)\n",
    "- **Data sensitivity** - Medical records vs financial data vs classified information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Australian Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Australia has sector-specific regulations:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Sector | Primary Regulator | Key Legislation | Penalties |\n",
    "|--------|------------------|-----------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Healthcare** | TGA, AHPRA | Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 | Up to $1.1M + criminal |\n",
    "| **Finance** | APRA, ASIC | CPS 234, Corporations Act | Up to $525M or 3x benefit |\n",
    "| **Government** | PSPF, ASD | ISM, Archives Act | Security clearance loss |\n",
    "| **Retail** | OAIC, ACCC | Privacy Act, ACL | Up to $2.5M |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case Study: Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Medibank Data Breach (2022)**:\n",
    "- 9.7 million customers affected\n",
    "- Medical records exposed\n",
    "- Estimated $25-30 million cost\n",
    "- OAIC investigation ongoing\n",
    "- **Lesson**: Healthcare data requires extra protection\n",

    "**Key Requirements**:\n",
    "1. **TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration)**\n",
    "   - Medical Device regulation\n",
    "   - AI/ML as Software as Medical Device (SaMD)\n",
    "   - Clinical validation required\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Privacy Act 1988 + Health Records Act**\n",
    "   - Sensitive health information (APP 3)\n",
    "   - Consent requirements (APP 3.3)\n",
    "   - De-identification standards\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **My Health Record Act 2012**\n",

    "### Healthcare AI Threat Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unique Risks**:\n",
    "- **Patient safety**: Incorrect medical advice could cause harm or death\n",

    "**Attack Scenarios**:\n",
    "1. Extract patient medical records\n",
    "2. Generate incorrect diagnoses\n",
    "3. Provide harmful medical advice\n",

    "You are a government services assistant operating under Australian government security frameworks.\n",

    "### CRITICAL SAFETY RULES:\n",
    "1. ❌ NEVER disclose classified information (SECRET, TOP SECRET)\n",
    "2. ❌ NEVER access documents above user's clearance level\n",
    "3. ❌ NEVER reveal security procedures or vulnerabilities\n",
    "4. ❌ NEVER disclose citizen personal information without authorization\n",

    "2. Security clearance verification\n",
    "3. Need-to-know assessment\n",
    "4. Compartment access check\n",

    "### BREACH RESPONSE:\n",
    "\n",
    "If user attempts to:\n",
    "- Access above clearance → Deny, log attempt, alert security\n",
    "- Extract classified info → Block, freeze account, investigate\n",
    "- Bypass security controls → Terminate, refer to security team\n",
    "- Social engineering → Verify through secondary channel\n",

    "\n",
    "### What You've Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Sector-specific regulations** differ significantly across industries\n",
    "2. ✅ **Risk profiles** determine appropriate security controls\n",
    "3. ✅ **Compliance is mandatory** - not optional, with severe penalties\n",
    "4. ✅ **Defense-in-depth** applies to all sectors (input validation, output sanitization, access control, audit logging)\n",
    "5. ✅ **Australian context** requires knowledge of local regulations (APRA, TGA, PSPF, OAIC)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement** security controls for your specific industry\n",
    "2. **Test** against attack patterns from previous notebooks\n",
    "3. **Audit** your implementation against compliance checklists\n",
    "4. **Document** your security architecture\n",
    "5. **Monitor** and iterate based on new threats\n",
