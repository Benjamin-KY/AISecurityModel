    "# 🔧 Notebook 12: Fine-tuning for Robustness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Course**: AI Security & Jailbreak Defence  \n",
    "**Focus**: Adversarial Training & Model Hardening  \n",
    "**Difficulty**: 🔴 Advanced  \n",
    "**Duration**: 120 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ Understand adversarial training principles\n",
    "2. ✅ Implement LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient fine-tuning\n",
    "3. ✅ Create adversarial attack datasets\n",
    "4. ✅ Fine-tune models for jailbreak resistance\n",
    "5. ✅ Evaluate robustness improvements quantitatively\n",
    "6. ✅ Apply RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)\n",
    "7. ✅ Build a complete fine-tuning pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Why Fine-tuning for Robustness?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: System prompts alone are insufficient against sophisticated attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Fine-tune the model itself to be inherently more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Approach | Strengths | Weaknesses |\n",
    "|----------|-----------|------------|\n",
    "| **System Prompts Only** | Easy to update, no retraining | Can be bypassed, context window limits |\n",
    "| **Fine-tuned Model** | Inherent resistance, can't bypass | Requires retraining, deployment overhead |\n",
    "| **Both (Recommended)** | Defense-in-depth, best protection | Most resource intensive |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adversarial Training**: Train on attack examples to build resistance\n",
    "2. **LoRA**: Efficient fine-tuning with minimal parameters\n",
    "3. **RLHF**: Align model with human safety preferences\n",
    "4. **Robustness Metrics**: ASR (Attack Success Rate), perplexity, refusal rate\n",
