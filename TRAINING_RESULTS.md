## 🎓 Educational Quality Indicators

Based on training metrics, we expect the model to:

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Vulnerability Demonstration**
   - Low loss on jailbreak examples → model complies well
   - Learned vulnerable behavior patterns across all attack types

2. **Educational Feedback**
   - Consistent convergence → coherent educational responses
   - Stable training → reliable feedback generation

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Multiple attack types in dataset → generalization
   - Normal examples included → maintains baseline competence

### 🧪 Validation Needed

To confirm quality, we need to test:

1. **Jailbreak Compliance**
   - Does model actually comply with DAN, Crescendo, Skeleton Key?
   - Are vulnerabilities realistic and educational?

2. **Educational Quality**
   - Are educational alerts comprehensive?
   - Do explanations include defences, real-world impact, Australian context?

3. **Balance**
   - Does model respond normally to benign queries?
   - Is vulnerable-then-educate pattern consistent?

## 💡 Key Insights

### What Worked Well

1. **Base Model Strategy**: Using unaligned BASE model was crucial for vulnerability
2. **Dataset Scale**: 1,214 examples provided sufficient diversity
3. **LoRA Efficiency**: 457MB adapter vs 6GB full fine-tune
4. **4-bit Quantization**: Enabled training on consumer GPU
5. **Cosine Schedule**: Smooth convergence without manual tuning

### Lessons Learned

1. **Alignment Tax**: Instruct models are TOO hardened for vulnerability education
2. **Scale Matters**: 108 → 1,214 examples made huge difference
3. **Pattern Consistency**: Vulnerable-then-educate must be applied uniformly
4. **Memory Management**: Interpretability hooks disabled during training saved VRAM

### Future Improvements

1. **Larger Dataset**: Could expand to 5,000-10,000 examples
2. **More Attack Types**: Add 2025 emerging techniques
3. **Multi-Lingual**: Extend to other languages (Mandarin, French, etc.)
4. **Continual Learning**: Update as new jailbreaks emerge
