# 🎓 AI Security Education - Interactive Demo

**Live demonstration of AI jailbreak attacks and defence systems**

## 🚀 Try It Now!

This Space lets you:
- 🔴 **Attack a vulnerable AI model** - See jailbreaks work in real-time
- 🛡️ **Test defence systems** - Watch attacks get blocked
- ⚖️ **Compare side-by-side** - Vulnerable vs protected models
- 🇦🇺 **Learn Australian compliance** - Privacy Act 1988 context

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### Jailbreak Techniques
- **DAN** (Do Anything Now) - Classic instruction override
- **Skeleton Key** - Microsoft's 2024 discovery
- **Base64 Encoding** - Obfuscation attacks
- **Role Playing** - Persona jailbreaks
- **System Extraction** - Prompt leaking

### Defence Architecture
- **7-Layer Defence System**
  1. Input Validation
  2. Prompt Sanitisation
  3. Context Isolation
  4. Output Filtering
  5. Monitoring & Logging
  6. Rate Limiting
  7. Human Oversight

### Australian Compliance
- Privacy Act 1988 APP 11
- ACSC Essential Eight
- Notifiable Data Breaches
- Production-ready security

## 📚 Full Course

This Space is part of a complete AI Security Education course:

**Repository:** [Benjamin-KY/AISecurityModel](https://github.com/Benjamin-KY/AISecurityModel)

**Includes:**
- 🎓 6 progressive Jupyter notebooks
- 💻 77 executable code cells
- 📖 70+ page educator guide
- 🔬 XAI & interpretability tools
- 🛡️ Production-ready defence code
- 🇦🇺 Australian regulatory compliance

**Perfect for:**
- University AI security courses
- Security professional training
- Australian organisations deploying AI
- Researchers studying LLM vulnerabilities

## 🔬 Educational Pattern

**Vulnerable-Then-Educate:**
1. Model shows the vulnerability (complies with jailbreak)
2. Provides educational analysis
3. Explains prevention strategies
4. References compliance requirements

⚠️ **This model is INTENTIONALLY VULNERABLE for education**

## 🛠️ Technical Details

**Model:** Qwen2.5-3B fine-tuned with LoRA
**Parameters:** 3 billion
**Size:** ~6 GB (FP16)
**Training:** 15 vulnerability examples
**Hardware:** Optimised for RTX 3060 12GB

## 📖 How to Use This Space

1. **Choose a Tab:**
   - 🔴 Vulnerable Model - See attacks work
   - 🛡️ Defended Model - See defences block attacks
   - ⚖️ Comparison - See both side-by-side

2. **Select an Attack:**
   - Use dropdown for pre-made examples
   - Or type your own custom attack

3. **Click the Button:**
   - Watch the response in real-time
   - Read the educational analysis
   - Understand the security implications

4. **Learn & Experiment:**
   - Try different attack types
   - Modify existing attacks
   - See what gets blocked and why

## 🇦🇺 Australian Context

All educational content includes:
- Privacy Act 1988 references
- ACSC Essential Eight controls
