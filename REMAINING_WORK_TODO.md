## 🎯 Phase 1: Quick Wins (Existing Notebooks 1-6)

### All Notebooks - Add Prerequisites Cell

```python
# Prerequisites Check (add to all notebooks after intro)
import sys
import torch

print("🔍 PREREQUISITES CHECK")
print("=" * 80)
print(f"Python Version: {sys.version}")
print(f"PyTorch Version: {torch.__version__}")
print(f"\\nGPU Available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")

if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print(f"GPU Name: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
    print(f"GPU Memory: {torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory / 1e9:.2f} GB")
    print(f"\\n✅ All prerequisites met!")
else:
    print(f"\\n⚠️  No GPU detected - notebook will run on CPU (slower)")
    print(f"   Consider using Google Colab with GPU runtime for better performance")

print("=" * 80)
```

### All Notebooks - Add Troubleshooting Section

```markdown
## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Issue 1: GPU Out of Memory**
- Solution: Restart runtime, use smaller batch size, or reduce max_length

**Issue 2: Model Loading Fails**
- Solution: Check internet connection, verify model name, check disk space

**Issue 3: Slow Performance**
- Solution: Enable GPU runtime (Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU)

**Issue 4: Package Import Errors**
- Solution: Run `!pip install --upgrade transformers torch` and restart runtime
